# Caddy Docker + Layer4 module
Image repo for extending Caddy-docker with the Layer-4 loadbalancing plugin

This does nothing more than grab the caddy-builder image, installs the Caddy-L4 module, grabs the caddy image, moves the module files to the new image and finally builds and uploads the new image to this repo.

Feel free to use this as an example or, if you need the pre-built image available, use it in your environment.

No files are changed from the official files.
